- [x] perf testing
- [ ] CI perf testing
- [ ] All components use `resin-components` lib
- [ ] Analytics are in stand alone module (awaiting PRs in [resin-analytics](https://github.com/resin-io-modules/))
- [ ] Autogenerate `locals.js` from readme
- [ ] export css file instead of injecting it
- [ ] use Preact to reduce bundle size
- [ ] extract everything besides (pages) to stand alone lib.
