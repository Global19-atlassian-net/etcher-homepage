Cool things:
- [x] prefetch links & code splitting (performance of a website with app responsiveness there after)
- [ ] CI perf testing
- [ ] All components use `resin-components` lib
- [ ] Analytics are in stand alone module
- [ ] Autogenerate `locals.js` from readme
- [ ] export css file instead of injecting it
- [ ] use Preact to reduce bundle size
- [ ] extract everything besides (maybe pages) to stand alone lib. (`landr`)
